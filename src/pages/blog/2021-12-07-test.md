You smell of daisies from the flowers in your hair\
It's dancing all around that windy desert air\
You slowly form your smile\
I'm no longer there\
I'm no longer there, no

I'll be fine\
You'll keep growing\
I'll be fine\
We both know it

I hope you're better off without me\
In your bed and sleeping soundly\
Dreaming in the arms of someone new\
I hope you're better off without me\
Bet you love the one you found\
He's perfect for you, everything you need\
I hope you're better without me

I heard you stopped smoking, I heard you settled down\
They say you broke your hold from that old paper town\
And I see love you the way you deserve love now\
You deserve love now, oh

I've been fine\
And you've been growing\
And I've been alright\
And we both know it

I hope you're better off without me\
In your bed and sleeping soundly\
Dreaming in the arms of someone new\
I hope you're better off without me\
Bet you love the one you found\
He's perfect for you, everything you need\
I hope you're better without me

This world just keeps turning\
That fire keeps burning\
And we just can't slow it down\
And that train just keeps rolling\
That river keeps flowing\
But I'm happy you've made it out

I've been fine\
And you've been growing\
And I've been alright\
And we both know it

I hope you're better off without me\
In your bed and sleeping soundly\
Dreaming in the arms of someone new\
I hope you're better off without me\
Bet you love the one you found\
He's perfect for you, everything you need\
I hope you're better without me

This world just keeps turning\
That fire keeps burning\
And we just can't slow it down\
And I hope you're better without me\
And that train just keeps rolling\
That river keeps flowing\
But I'm happy you've made it out\
And I hope you're better without\
And I hope you're better without me
